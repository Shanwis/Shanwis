# Hi, I'm Ashwin/Shanwis! 👋

I'm a software developer and tech enthusiast passionate about building and exploring new technologies. I'm currently diving deep into **Quantum Computing**, **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, **AI**, and **IoT**. I have got a recent interest into **homelabs** as well.

I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or discussing new ideas.
